Q2. Difference between var, let and const with example.

    1. var -   In js, to declare a variable 'var' keyword is used.
               It has Global Scope.
               Ex. var name='Vaish'
    
    2. let -   In js, to declare a variable 'let' keyword is used.
               It has Block Scope.
               Ex. { let name='Vaish'  }
                  In this example, scope is limited to Block i.e. within these brackets.
    
    3. const - In js, to declare a constant variable 'const' keyword is used.
               It has Block / Function Scope.
               Ex. const name='Vaish'
                  In this example, we can't chnage the value of name variable.
